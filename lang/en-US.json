  "icims_desc": "During my time with the Video Studio team, I was responsible for both maintaining and developing new features for the product. Our primary tech stack consisted of Vue and Angular, though I also contributed to React projects, including building a custom Video Player web component from scratch using Preact. \n\n One of the first projects I took full control of was leading the development of a Chrome extension, designed from the ground up using Vue. The extension enabled cross-team collaboration and enhanced access to product features, providing significant improvements for users. \n\n In addition to my development role, I served as Scrum Master for a year, where I facilitated Agile ceremonies such as sprint planning, grooming sessions, daily stand-ups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives plus collaborating closely with the product manager, assisting with ticket management and creating metrics to measure and improve team maturity. \n\n I also participated in our team’s “office hours” initiative, where we set aside 2 hours and 30 minutes every Tuesday and Thursday to help anyone who needed assistance. This was a great way to foster collaboration, answer questions, and help others learn more about the Video Studio app.",
  "z1_desc": "I had the opportunity to work in a really great environment, surrounded by passionate individuals who genuinely enjoyed what they were doing. Everyone was highly detail-oriented, and the focus on design was always front and center, especially since many of our clients were the ones defining the app’s functionality. <br/><br/> It was also an incredible learning experience for me, as it was my first time working with up-to-date frameworks like Angular, Vue, React, and Next. Furthermore, every client I collaborated with was an English speaker or from overseas, which made the work even more interesting and broadened my perspective. <br/><br/> Some notable projects I worked on while on Z1 were for <a href=\"https://www.sendtrumpet.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Trumpet</a>, <a href=\"https://www.smartvault.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Smartvault</a> client portal and API documentation, <a href=\"https://www.localist.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Localist</a> theming system revamp using liquid, <a href=\"https://logistimatics.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Logistimatics</a> website and store, <a href=\"https://www.biograph.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Biograph</a> user portal and <a href=\"https://www.alloy.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Alloy</a> identity verification process between others. <br/><br/>During my time on Z1 I spent a decent amount of time co-managing the front-end development team, mentored junior developers, and handled performance evaluations and reviews while also doing my coding duties.",
